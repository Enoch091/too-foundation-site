        <p>Domestic violence laws, like all legal frameworks, are designed to protect victims. In addition
to offering protection, these laws clearly define behaviours that constitute abuse and establish
legal measures, such as court orders, to prevent further incidents. The primary focus of these
laws is to ensure the safety and well-being of victims.<BR>
<BR>It is fair to say that many victims of domestic violence may resemble individuals suffering from
Stockholm syndrome. This phenomenon can arise from several factors, including a lack of
awareness about the laws designed to protect them, a deep mistrust of law enforcement
agencies that may dismiss their cries for help, or the intense fear instilled in them by their
abusers.<BR>
<BR>The modus operandi of these abusers typically follows a predictable pattern, they first
disenfranchise their victims financially, then subject them to physical and verbal abuse to
create psychological tension. This manipulation leads victims to believe that their abuser is
their only chance at a normal life. In some cases, these abusers may bribe law enforcement,
resulting in victims being sent back to their abusers. This is the situation many times faced by
activists, NGOs and CSOs alike when dealing with victims of domestic abuse, but then… who
can blame them?<BR>
<BR>It’s unfortunate that many victims of domestic violence are unaware that domestic violence
is a valid ground for divorce. According to Section 9(2)(a) of the Matrimonial Causes Act, it
states that;
“since the marriage, the respondent has behaved in such a way that the petitioner cannot
reasonably be expected to live with the respondent.”
This provision clearly indicates that no one should be expected to remain in a relationship
where their safety and well-being are consistently jeopardised.<BR>
<BR>Every form and act of abuse endangers the victim's life, whether it is physical, verbal,
economic, or mental abuse. There have been heartbreaking cases of women who have died
during childbirth due to abandonment by the child's father. Additionally, many victims have
developed life-threatening illnesses as a result of emotional and mental abuse. It is safe to say
that every act of abuse can pose both direct and indirect threats to life and according to the
provisions of the Matrimonial Causes Act, the law does not expect anyone to tolerate or
endure such abusive relationship.<BR>
<BR>The Violence Against Persons (Prohibition) Act (VAPP) defines economic abuse as forced
financial dependence, denial of inheritance or succession rights, and unreasonable
deprivation of economic or financial resources that a person is entitled to or needs for survival.
This includes essential resources such as household necessities, mortgage or bond
repayments, or rent for shared residences.According to Section 9(1) of the VAPP Act;
“A person who forcefully evicts his or her spouse from his or her home or refuses him or her
access commits an offence and is liable on conviction to a term of imprisonment not exceeding
2 years or to a fine not exceeding three hundred thousand Naira (₦300,000).”
Additionally, Section 12(1) states;
“A person who causes forced financial dependence or economic abuse of another commits an
offence and is liable on conviction to a term of imprisonment not exceeding 2 years or to a fine
not exceeding five hundred thousand Naira (₦500,000).”<BR>
<BR>These provisions clearly aim to prevent economic abuse, particularly against women.
Unfortunately, it remains common in Nigeria for women to be thrown into the streets with
their children by their partners, or even widows after their husbands' deaths. This has
persisted for so long that it has become an accepted response during conflicts and many
women find themselves trapped in abusive marriages or relationships due to this fear of
poverty. As earlier pointed out, it’s their modus operandi, first to subject their victims to
financial hardship, just to hold the power to manipulate their victims into staying in the
relationship.<BR>
<BR>Section 14(1) of the VAPP Act states;
“A person who causes emotional, verbal, and psychological abuse on another commits an
offence and is liable on conviction to a term of imprisonment not exceeding 1 year or to a fine
not exceeding one hundred thousand Naira (₦100,000).”
The Act further defines emotional, verbal, and psychological abuse as a pattern of degrading
or humiliating conduct towards a person, which includes repeated insults, ridicule or namecalling, repeated threats to cause emotional pain, and repeated displays of obsessive
possessiveness. Such behaviour constitutes a serious invasion of the person’s privacy, liberty,
integrity, or security.<BR>
<BR>This provision is deemed all encompassing and, in my view, very clear, lacking any ambiguity.
Prior to this Act, many abusers had mastered the art of verbal and psychological abuse
because it was often difficult to prove in court. Sadly, some victims have even become
psychiatric patients as a result of this form of abuse. Ongoing research and development
within the law continue to seek solutions to these issues, but what is truly needed is radical
advocacy to raise awareness and make these protections accessible to those who genuinely
need them.
Another prevalent form of abuse is abandonment and stalking. In December 2025, we
initiated a charity project aimed at empowering single mothers and widows. During our
interviews with beneficiaries, it was shocking to discover how frequently abusers abandontheir children with their mothers. These men often compel women to give birth to multiple
children and then leave them to care for these children alone.
These women face the daunting challenge of working while also being expected to train and
protect their children. In many cases, they struggle to provide even basic necessities, leaving
their children vulnerable to abuse due to a lack of protection. Although Section 16(1) of the
VAPP Act addresses this issue, but it is insufficient.<BR>
<BR>The government must enact stiffer laws to safeguard children's rights. Abandonment can lead
to severe consequences, including child labor, sexual abuse, and a lack of adequate education
for abandoned children. While the legal system addresses the abuser, it is equally important
to implement measures that mitigate the impact of such reprehensible actions on victims.
This includes providing education, accommodation, and, when necessary, employment
opportunities or empowerment programs for the affected women.
The law regarding domestic violence is continually evolving, which is commendable. It is
essential for lawyers to leverage these laws effectively to protect victims. However, the
government must also implement policies aimed at preventing these abuses from occurring
in the first place.
Above all, these laws are meaningless if victims are unaware of their rights. The importance
of advocacy cannot be overemphasised, not just for the victims, but for society as a whole.
We must work together to eliminate the stigma surrounding single mothers. Let us promote
the idea of being our sister’s keeper, and offer support rather than judgment to those affected
by domestic violence.<BR>
<BR>It is crucial to adopt a proactive approach in addressing domestic violence. Every member of
society needs to contribute to this effort if we hope to eradicate this issue that threatens our
future. We have already lost many talents to these acts of abuse, and countless gifted children
have fallen victim to negative social vices, depriving society of their potential contributions.<BR>
