        <p class="fs-lead">How TOOF Helped Reunite Sarah With Her Children Across Borders</p>

        <p>When Sarah (name changed for privacy) first walked into The Olanike Omopariola Foundation (TOOF) office, her eyes were clouded with pain and exhaustion. Her two young children had been illegally taken abroad by her estranged husband, leaving her helpless and terrified. For months, she lived every mother’s worst nightmare , sleepless nights, endless calls to authorities, and the constant fear that she might never see her children again.

Her husband, who had a history of emotional and physical abuse, disappeared with the children under the guise of a family vacation. It wasn’t until Sarah received a message from a relative abroad that she realised the trip had been a calculated plan to separate her from her children permanently.

“I felt like my whole world had ended,” Sarah recalls. “I didn’t know who to trust or where to turn. Everywhere I went, I was told it was complicated because it involved another country.”</p>

<p>That was when she found TOOF. Upon hearing her story, TOOF immediately sprang into action, rallying support from key government agencies, including the National Human Rights Commission, Interpol, and Nigerian Customs.

The journey was long and challenging. TOOF’s legal team ensured every step was handled through the courts, safeguarding Sarah’s rights and ensuring her children were returned legally and safely. TOOF also offered Sarah emotional support, legal guidance, and a safe space to rebuild her strength during the process.

After months of painstaking effort, Sarah’s perseverance paid off, her children were finally brought back home. The reunion was filled with tears, laughter, and overwhelming relief.

“The day I held my children again, I knew hope was real,” Sarah said, her voice breaking with emotion. “TOOF gave me back my family and my voice. They never gave up on me.”</p>

<p>Today, Sarah is an advocate for other mothers experiencing cross-border custody battles. Her story is a powerful reminder that justice is possible when survivors are given the right support and access to justice.

At TOOF, we remain committed to protecting women and children, ensuring that no family is torn apart by abuse or injustice.
[6:29 PM, 9/10/2025] Ariyike: “From Pain to Purpose: How TOOF Helped Grace Rebuild Her Life and Business After Abuse”

For years, Grace (name changed) endured the torment of a violent marriage. Her husband not only physically and emotionally abused her but also refused to take financial responsibility for their children, leaving her struggling to feed and clothe them.

Grace’s breaking point came one night when the violence escalated, and she realised she needed to escape to protect herself and her children. A neighbour connected her with The Olanike Omopariola Foundation (TOOF), and from that moment, her life began to change.

TOOF provided immediate intervention, rescuing Grace and her children from the abusive home and placing them in a safe location. Beyond physical safety, TOOF understood that true empowerment comes from economic independence.

After listening to Grace’s story and assessing her needs, TOOF decided to set her up with a Point-of-Sale (POS) business, giving her the opportunity to earn a steady income and regain her dignity.

“For the first time, I feel like I can breathe,” Grace said with tears in her eyes. “TOOF didn’t just rescue me , they gave me the tools to stand on my own two feet and provide for my children.”</p>

<p>Today, Grace’s POS business is thriving. She has become financially independent, able to pay school fees, provide nutritious meals for her children, and even save for the future. She now dreams of expanding her business and mentoring other women who are trying to rebuild their lives after abuse.

Grace’s story is a testament to TOOF’s mission: breaking the cycle of abuse by equipping survivors with the resources to live free and dignified lives.

At TOOF, we believe that every woman deserves safety, independence, and hope , and with collective action, we can turn stories of survival into stories of success.</p>
